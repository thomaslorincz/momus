# Momus
Investigating the potential of a character-level RNN for the purpose of telling jokes.
## Training and Running
From command line: `python rnn.py`
## Tentative Results
After several thousand iterations, characters will appear to have the cadence of a joke. More dataset sanitization or a new dataset may provide better results.
